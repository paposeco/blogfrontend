# Blog API for The Odin Project

This is the frontend repository for this project and the blog [More Oranges](https://paposeco.github.io/blogfrontend) is hosted on github pages. The [API repository](https://github.com/paposeco/blogapi) is also on github, currently hosted on Railway. 

## Features

Besides the blog posts and comments, which everyone has access to, there's an editor for creating new posts and editing old ones. The editor is private, which is why I'm including a few screenshots.
